The governance of a <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a> is embodied by the set of processes by which it decides how to make (other) decisions, how <a href="#actor" title="An Actor is someone or something that can actually do things, such as people or machines.">actors</a> that it <a href="#employee">employs</a> are to behave and operate, and ensure this guidance ends up in documents (which we will call <a href="#policy" title="A policy is a (set of) rules, working instructions and/or other guidance for the execution of one or more kinds of actions.">policies</a>).</p>

<dd><p><strong>Identity</strong> is a term that is heavily debated.

Generalizing this idea, we say that the identity of any <a href="#entity" title="An entity is someone or something that some party knows to exist, be it some person, some computer, an extinct animal, a thought, an idea, a JSON-object, etc.">entity</a> consists of the combined <a href="#knowledge" title="Knowledge is the (intangible) sum of what is known, the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something (WikiPedia).">knowledge</a> (that is: of all <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a> that know) about this entity.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf">Pfitzmann and Hansen (2010)</a>, we define a <a href="#partial-identity">partial identity</a> (of an <a href="#entity" title="An entity is someone or something that some party knows to exist, be it some person, some computer, an extinct animal, a thought, an idea, a JSON-object, etc.">entity</a>) as all the <a href="#knowledge" title="Knowledge is the (intangible) sum of what is known, the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something (WikiPedia).">knowledge</a> that a single, specific <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a> has about that entity (= the 'subject' of the <a href="#partial-identity">partial identity</a>).

<dd><p>A <strong>Risk</strong> is the effects that uncertainty can have on the intended realization of an <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a> of a <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a> (which we call the <a href="#owner" title="An Owner is a role that a party performs when it is exercizing its legal, rightful or natural title to control some entity.">risk owner</a>). Uncertainty is a lack of information, understanding or <a href="#knowledge" title="Knowledge is the (intangible) sum of what is known, the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something (WikiPedia).">knowledge</a> of events, their consequences or likelihoods, and this may affect the results that a party expects and intends to realize so as to fulfull its objectives.</p>
<p>While traditionally these effects are assumed to be negative (i.e. damaging, harmful) to this party, they may also be positive. For example, if you buy a ticket in a lottery, you (should) expect to lose money (the prize of the ticket). However, there is this uncertainty, this lack of information, the effect of it would be that this intended/expected result is deviated from, and you actually win a prize. If this risk is unacceptable (e.g. if you do not know how to manage large amounts of money), then that would call the risk to be <a href="#risk-management" title="Risk management is a process that is run by (or on behalf of) a specific party for the purpose of managing the risks that it owns.">managed</a>.</p>
<p>Risk is about the <em>possible</em> effects that uncertainty may have on the intended/expected realization of an <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a> of some <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a>. In this sense, at least in theory, this means that 'risk' is an objective notion because different parties may have the same ideas about what such effects on a given <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a> could be. However, since an  <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a> is owned by precisely one <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a>, and therefore only that party actually knows the actual meaning of that objective, in practice there is little point in drafting lists of such possible effects to make risk assessments easier.</p>
<p>An <em>acceptable risk</em> is a set of such effects that the <a href="#risk-owner">risk owner</a> has decided that it can, and is willing to deal with as they materialize. They need no further attention. Other risks would need attention and should be <a href="#risk-management" title="Risk management is a process that is run by (or on behalf of) a specific party for the purpose of managing the risks that it owns.">managed</a>. Often, risks are assigned a <a href="#risk-level">risk level</a> to help risk owners prioritize the risks, allowing them to manage the most important ones before the less important ones.</p>
<p>The <a href="#owner" title="An Owner is a role that a party performs when it is exercizing its legal, rightful or natural title to control some entity.">owner</a> of a risk that is associated with an <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a> must be the <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a> that <a href="#owner" title="An Owner is a role that a party performs when it is exercizing its legal, rightful or natural title to control some entity.">owns</a> that <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a>, and vice versa, because <a href="#ownership" title="Ownership is a relationship between two entities in which one of these entities (called the owner) is entitled to enjoy, dispose of, and control the other entity in an pretty much absolute (sovereign) fashion.">ownership</a> implies the <a href="#authority" title="An Authority is a party of which certain decisions, ideas, rules etc.">authority</a> to realize the <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a>, which in turn implies the authority to manage the associated risks.

In fact, the objective of mandating risk management activities may come with risks which are often overlooked.</p>

<p>The dialogue about what Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) really is — started in the blog &quot;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity</a>&quot; by Christopher Allen in 2016 — has not resulted in a consensus today. While some see the ten principles of SSI that Allen proposed as the definition of SSI, he formulated them as &quot;a departure point to provoke a discussion about what's truly important&quot;. And it is obvious that what is important differs per <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a>.</p>

This implies that every <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a> has - and maintains - its own (subjective) semantics, which is its subjective mapping of a set of terms onto the concepts/ideas in its <a href="#knowledge" title="Knowledge is the (intangible) sum of what is known, the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something (WikiPedia).">knowledge</a>. The (erroneous) assumption that <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a> would (automagically) share a semantics is the cause of many misunderstandings, and hence should be identified and deleted as soon as possible.</p>

<dd><p>An <strong>SSI Assurance Community</strong> is a <a href="#community" title="A Community is an organization that seeks to facilitate the cooperation between at least two parties (referred to as its 'members') based on interests that these parties share as each of them seeks to realize its own, individual objectives.">community</a> that supports its members as they seek to increase their confidence in the <a href="#ssi-infrastructure" title="The SSI Infrastructure consists of the technological components that are (envisaged to be) deployed all over the world for the purpose of providing, requesting and obtaining qualified data for the purpose of negotiating and/or executing electronic transactions.">SSI infrastructure</a> and/or (specific) <a href="#qualified-data">qualifications</a> of the data exchanged through that infrastructure.&quot; The nature of a community being that its members share some common ground ensures that this objective may be realized by exploing that existing common ground.</p>
<p>Here are some functions that an assurance community may contemplate of performing:</p>
<ul>
<li>act as a <a href="#governor">governing party</a> for a set of <a href="#credential-type">credential types</a>.</li>
<li>run a <a href="#credential-catalogue">credential catalogue</a> in which its members (and perhaps others) can advertise the <a href="#credential-type">credential types</a> they issue and specify the assurances and other data that <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a> may need in order to decide whether or not to take that member up on that offering.</li>
<li>run a yellow pages service which <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a> can use to find out which members (or other parties) issue credentials of a certain type.</li>
<li>govern and document accreditation schemes, including schemes for accrediting parties that may certify others against such schemes.</li>
<li>act as a <a href="#governor">governing party</a> for decision trees (<strong>to be elaborated on</strong>)</li>
<li>act as a KeySmith (<strong>also to be elaborated on</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial ideas for SSI Assurance Communities can be read in the paper &quot;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FQTxzQ9z9Tv-WA_UYyfF8AgvEfBYBWRgGvSdjsQof4s/edit#heading=h.cj0pu3kcmf2q">Decentralized SSI Governance, the missing link in automating business decisions</a>&quot;.</p>

<dd><p>The <strong>SSI Infrastructure</strong> consists of the technological components that are (envisaged to be) deployed all over the world for the purpose of providing, requesting and obtaining <a href="#qualified-data">qualified data</a> for the purpose of negotiating and/or executing electronic <a href="#transaction">transactions</a>.</p>
<p>Like any other (hard) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure">Infrastructure</a>, such components are (to be) designed to be interoperable, both</p>
<ul>
<li>'horizontally', i.e. with other infrastructural components, and</li>
<li>'vertically', i.e. that it is very easy for other software applications to use them.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is foreseen that SSI components in this infrastructure are designed and created in a generic way, and hence need to be customizable, so that an individual compnent can work according to the (needs and preferences|policy)-of-the <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a> for which it is an <a href="#agent" title="An Agent is an actor that is executing an action action on behalf of some party (which we call the principal of that agent).">agent</a>.</p>
<p>This implies that the SSI Infrastructure (a 'hard' infratstructure) needs to be complemented with a complementary 'soft infrastructure', e.g. as can be provided with <a href="#ssi-assurance-community" title="An SSI Assurance Community is a community that supports its members as they seek to increase their confidence in the SSI infrastructure and/or (specific) qualifications of the data exchanged through that infrastructure.&quot; The nature of a community being that its members share some common ground ensures that this objective may be realized by exploing that existing common ground.">assurance communities</a>.</p>
